# MovieArcs
What if you could visualize the emotional journey of a movie? And what if you could find recurring patterns across thousands of films? In this project, we used sentiment analysis, time series normalization, and clustering to uncover common emotional arcs â€” just like Kurt Vonnegut described in his famous lectures on story shapes.
